# To run this code 
npm run dev

## 2026-10-12 Codex project check

- `npm.cmd run lint` passed (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `npm.cmd run build` passed; Vite reported existing native-config and large-chunk warnings.
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/sevak/register` returned HTTP 200 from the existing local server.
- Read-only Supabase checks confirmed `get_my_sevak_profile` exists and denies anonymous execution; `sevak_profiles` denies anonymous table access as expected. No active departments were visible to the public role.
- No database changes were applied. Supabase CLI, Docker, authenticated project access, and a signed-in Sevak/admin test session are unavailable in this environment, so migrations and authenticated registration/photo/admin flows remain unverified.

## 2026-10-12 Sevak ID repair

- Added `20261016_sevak_self_registration_id_default.sql`: omitted IDs receive a database default, and the self-registration BEFORE INSERT guard is recreated. It changes no existing rows; administrator-supplied IDs remain supported.
- Added Node regression tests for the database ID guard, data preservation, administrator ID handling, and the client insert payload.
- `npm.cmd test`: 4 passed, including an alphabetical trigger-order regression check. `npm.cmd run lint`: passed. `npm.cmd run build`: passed with the existing Vite configuration and bundle-size warnings. The local Sevak portal route returned HTTP 200.
- Supabase and browser integrations are not connected in this session. The migration is local and has not been applied; remote migration history/schema and authenticated registration/photo/admin review still require those connections and authenticated test accounts.

## 2026-10-13 Sevak registration follow-up

- `npm.cmd test`: 4 passed; `npm.cmd run lint`: passed; `npm.cmd run build`: passed with existing Vite config and bundle-size warnings.
- The running local portal returned HTTP 200 at `/sevak/register`.
- Current workspace has no Supabase URL/key, Supabase CLI, Docker, database URL, or browser automation connection. The forward migration remains unapplied; live schema/migration history and authenticated profile/photo/admin flows cannot be verified here.

## 2026-10-13 Sevak My Profile navigation fix

- Removed the `/sevak/my-profile` redirect when no owner row is found; the page now explains that no profile exists and links to create one.
- New profile inserts explicitly include the current session `user.id` as `auth_user_id`. Existing trigger/RLS ownership checks and the unique owner index remain in force; no database records or policies were changed.
- Optional photo failures now show a separate warning with an explicit profile-saved confirmation and a My Profile link. Pending, approved, and rejected profile status views are preserved.
- Added regression coverage for ownership binding, owner RPC lookup, missing-profile navigation, status states, and separate photo failure feedback.
- `npm.cmd test`: 7 passed. `npm.cmd run lint`: passed. `npm.cmd run build`: passed with existing Vite config and large-chunk warnings. Live Supabase and browser flows were not available to verify.

## 2026-10-13 Sevak admin approval workflow review

- Kept the existing `/sevak-attendance` admin approval section. Approval/rejection updates now match both the selected profile ID and `approval_status = 'pending'`, preventing stale or duplicate decisions; successful decisions reset the list page and refresh data.
- Approval remains gated by the trusted-role RPC in the UI, administrator-only profile UPDATE RLS, and the database trigger. The trigger records `auth.uid()` and `now()` on approval; rejection requires a nonblank reason and is inactive. No policy or live database changes were made.
- Approved directory and attendance selectors require both `approval_status = 'approved'` and active status. Approval has no photo prerequisite; the existing detail panel provides private-photo retry and missing-photo/sample fallbacks.
- Added six approval workflow regression tests covering decisions, permissions, filtering, photos, and refresh behavior.
- Local checks: `npm.cmd test` passed (13 tests), `npm.cmd run lint` passed, and `npm.cmd run build` passed with existing Vite native-config and large-chunk warnings. No real pending profiles were modified. Live Supabase/browser behavior remains unverified.

## 2026-10-13 Sevak profile photo diagnosis

- Confirmed a local-path mismatch: the admin camera endpoint stored photo paths as `/sample-sevak/...`; Attendance recognized that path, but My Profile incorrectly passed it to private Storage `createSignedUrl`, so it could not display those photos.
- New admin camera uploads now go to the existing private `sevak-profiles` bucket and save `<sevak_id>/profile-<uuid>.jpg`; upload remains admin-authorized. Failed profile-path updates trigger best-effort removal of the unattached object. Existing bundled `/sample-sevak` paths remain readable for compatibility.
- Both views now recognize valid legacy sample paths and keep private object paths on the signed-URL path. Signed-link exceptions are surfaced instead of leaving the image state stuck.
- Added three photo regression tests, including an HTTP test of the upload route with mocked Supabase auth/storage/database calls. `npm.cmd test`: 16 passed; `npm.cmd run lint`: passed; `npm.cmd run build`: passed with the existing Vite configuration and large-chunk warnings.
- Local HTTP checks returned 200 for `/sevak/my-profile`, `/sevak-attendance`, and a bundled legacy JPEG (`image/jpeg`). No Supabase URL/key is configured in this workspace, so a real private Storage signed URL or a real user's photo could not be verified. No live records, migrations, or bucket settings were changed.

## 2026-10-13 Supabase photo verification follow-up

- Confirmed project URL and publishable/anon configuration exists in ignored `.env` (values were not displayed). A read-only `sevak_profiles` query with that public credential has no authenticated user session and is denied by RLS (`42501`); no profile path or Storage object could be read.
- The project has no Supabase CLI, service-role/DB credential, connected Supabase MCP tool, or browser automation package/session available here. No attempt was made to bypass RLS. Existing private bucket policies remain unchanged.
- Re-ran local checks: `npm.cmd test` passed (16 tests), `npm.cmd run lint` passed, `npm.cmd run build` passed with existing Vite warnings. Live photo display remains unverified pending a connected signed-in Sevak/admin browser session or an authorized read-only Supabase connection.

## 2026-10-13 Signed-in photo verification attempt

- Checked available Codex tools and the workspace for an attached browser automation/signed-in page session; none is available. No browser profile or stored session credentials were inspected.
- Used only the existing public Supabase project credential for a read-only query. No authenticated user session was present; RLS denied reading `sevak_profiles` (`42501`), so the current photo path, Storage object, and signed-URL image load could not be verified.
- No records, Storage objects, policies, or bucket settings were changed. For safe verification, open the local app at `http://localhost:3000/sevak/my-profile`, sign in through its normal BigBro login link, and view the photo; the page will request a signed URL under the signed-in user's existing RLS scope. The attendance page can similarly be checked after signing in with the authorized Sevak admin account.

## 2026-10-13 Final Sevak photo fix verification

- Added `src/utils/sevakProfilePhoto.mjs` as the shared resolver used by My Profile and Sevak Attendance. Valid legacy `/sample-sevak/...` paths continue to load as same-origin files; all other paths use signed URLs from the existing private `sevak-profiles` bucket under the authenticated Supabase client. Signing errors and absent signed URLs are surfaced to the existing page error states.
- The Admin camera endpoint writes new images to private Storage and saves the object path in `profile_picture`; it does not make the bucket public or require photo upload for profile submission/approval. The Compose configuration bind-mounts `./public/sample-sevak` to `/app/public/sample-sevak`, preserving legacy sample files on the host. The earlier referenced `t6-f642ca12-21b5-4423-aaa2-ab0480927648.jpg` remains in the tracked legacy directory and returned a local `image/jpeg` response (37,936 bytes); this is a bundled sample, not a real-user photo verification. Docker CLI is unavailable here, so a running container/mount was not inspected.
- A read-only anonymous Supabase request is denied by RLS (`42501`), and no authenticated browser session is attached. Thus the actual private profile path/object, signed URL, and real image load could not be verified. No live records, policies, bucket settings, migrations, or objects were changed. Earlier note wording claiming no Supabase project URL/configuration was available is superseded: public project URL/key configuration is present in ignored `.env`, but there is no authorized user session.
- Regression coverage now includes shared path resolution, legacy paths, private signed URL/error behavior, Docker bind-mount declaration, camera upload and failure handling, plus existing profile and approval regressions. `npm.cmd test`: 20 passed; `npm.cmd run lint`: passed; `npm.cmd run build`: passed with Vite native-config and large-chunk warnings. Local route/image HTTP checks do not prove a live private photo works.
- Remaining verification requires a normal signed-in BigBro browser session: a Sevak session for `/sevak/my-profile`, and the authorized Sevak administrator session for `/sevak-attendance`. `dailytask.md` was not modified.

## 2026-10-13 Sevak photo fix and connected-browser verification

- Re-inspected the existing worktree and confirmed the photo fix is already present in the current user changes; no additional application or database changes were needed. The root code mismatch was that legacy `/sample-sevak/...` paths were being sent to private Supabase Storage signed-URL generation by My Profile, while Attendance treated them as local files. The shared resolver now serves validated legacy paths directly and continues to sign private object paths. New administrator camera uploads go to the existing private `sevak-profiles` bucket instead of the app/container filesystem.
- Confirmed `profile_picture` is a nullable text object path; self-registration photos use `<sevak_id>/profile-<uuid>.<ext>`. The existing migrations define the private bucket and role/owner-scoped Storage policies; no bucket, policy, or database changes were made. Five Attendance demo image mappings and bundled JPEG/PNG examples are local UI/static assets, not evidence of live profile rows.
- Playwright MCP connected to the existing Chrome session. `/sevak/my-profile` showed the sign-in/create-account prompt, and `/sevak-attendance` displayed the anonymous RLS-blocked message, zero visible profiles, and the unauthenticated Login/Sign Up links. There is no active admin session in this browser. No authentication was bypassed. The bundled `t6-f642ca12-21b5-4423-aaa2-ab0480927648.jpg` loaded in Chrome at 640×480, confirming the legacy static-image path works. A real signed private object/photo cannot be verified until a normal authenticated owner/admin session is available; RLS also prevents reading live sample/profile rows anonymously.
- `npm.cmd test`: 20 passed, 0 failed. `npm.cmd run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`): passed. `npm.cmd run build`: passed; existing Vite native-config (`__dirname`) and >500 kB chunk warnings remain. Docker CLI is unavailable, so the declared Docker Compose bind mount and runtime container were inspected in configuration only, not run. No database records, Storage objects, Supabase policies/settings, or secrets were changed or exposed. `dailytask.md` was not modified.

## 2026-10-13 Sevak photo final recheck

- The current worktree already contains the code fix and photo regression coverage; this recheck made no application-code or database changes. The legacy local-photo/private-Storage mismatch is covered by `src/utils/sevakProfilePhoto.mjs`, My Profile, Attendance, and the existing private upload endpoint.
- Local Vite was already running on port 3000 and returned HTTP 200 for both Sevak routes; port 3001 had no listener, and no Docker CLI/service was available. No restart was needed. `dailytask.md` remains untouched.
- Playwright confirmed My Profile is unauthenticated and Attendance shows the RLS-blocked sign-in state. The browser has no active Sevak session or admin role. It also confirmed the bundled legacy JPEG request returned HTTP 200 (`image/jpeg`, 640×480); this is only sample-image verification, not a real private profile photo. The browser was left at `/login?next=%2Fsevak%2Fmy-profile`.
- The application auth flow uses Supabase `getSession`/`onAuthStateChange`; My Profile then calls `get_my_sevak_profile`, while Attendance checks `has_sevak_admin_role` and reads rows through RLS. Sign in normally with the profile owner's account to verify My Profile. Attendance photo verification requires a separate account carrying the authorized Sevak admin role. No credentials or session material were inspected or entered.
- Re-ran checks: `npm.cmd test` passed (20/20); `npm.cmd run lint` passed; `npm.cmd run build` passed with the existing `__dirname` config-loader and large-chunk warnings. Live profile/photo rows, signed private image requests, and deployed migration state remain unverified because no authenticated browser session is available.

## 2026-10-13 Existing Pending Sevak profile photo

- Root cause in the UI: profile creation can upload an optional image, but after a profile is Pending `/sevak/create-profile` redirects to My Profile and the My Profile panel had no photo-only edit control. The reported “No profile photo has been added” message is rendered when the loaded `profile_picture` is empty; a signed-URL request is only made when a path exists. The target row itself could not be queried in this session.
- Added a Pending-profile-only photo selector, local preview, and Save photo action in `src/components/SevakSelfRegistrationPage.tsx`. It uploads a selected JPEG/PNG/WebP (up to 2 MiB) to the private `sevak-profiles` bucket under that profile's own Sevak ID, then updates only `profile_picture` for the existing row. It does not insert/delete a profile or send approval/status fields. Upload/link failures are shown; unattached successful uploads are best-effort cleaned up. Existing profile-photo signed URL rendering remains in use.
- Added a regression test in `tests/sevak-profile-photos.test.mjs` for owner-folder private upload, photo-path-only update, pending-only availability, and owner-scoped read/upload policies. `npm.cmd test`: 21 passed, 0 failed. `npm.cmd run lint`: passed. `npm.cmd run build`: passed with the existing Vite native config (`__dirname`) and large-chunk warnings.
- Playwright inspected `/sevak/create-profile` and `/sevak/my-profile`. The connected Chrome session returned an authenticated profile different from the specified profile, so no profile mutation or image selection was attempted. Browser was left at `/login?next=%2Fsevak%2Fmy-profile` with the normal Logout control. A real target photo upload/reload and the target row's stored path remain unverified until the user signs out of that unrelated session, signs in as the account owning the specified SELF ID, and selects their own photo. The migration `20261014_sevak_self_registration_profile_photos.sql` defines the existing private owner upload/read rules; deployed migration state was not checked or changed. No secrets, database rows, Storage settings, or policies were changed. `dailytask.md` was not modified.
